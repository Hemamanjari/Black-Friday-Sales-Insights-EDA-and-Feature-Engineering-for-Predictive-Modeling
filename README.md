# EDA and Feature Engineering for Predictive-Modeling


                              Project Overview
              This project focuses on “Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)” and “Feature Engineering” on the “Black Friday Sales dataset” to uncover insights into customer purchase behavior and prepare high-quality features for predictive modeling.The analysis explores demographic, product, and purchase-related factors influencing customer spending patterns.
              
                              Objectives
                    - Perform detailed “Exploratory data analysis” to understand key trends and patterns in customer behavior.  
                    - Handle “missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data” for better data quality.  
                    - Engineer new features to improve predictive modeling performance (e.g., customer categories, product popularity, interaction features).  
                    - Visualize insights using interactive and static plots to guide data-driven decision-making.  
                              Key Insights & Highlights
                    - Identified top-spending “customer segments” based on age, gender, and occupation.  
                    - Observed that “married men in the 26–35 age group” were the highest spenders.  
                    - Discovered product categories with “consistent high sales across demographics”.  
                    - Created derived features like:
                      - `Customer_Age_Group`
                      - `Product_Popularity_Score`
                      - `Average_Spending_Per_Category`
                    - Prepared a “cleaned and feature-enriched dataset” ready for machine learning models (e.g., Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest).
                            Steps Performed
                    1. “Data Loading & Understanding”
                       - Loaded the dataset and examined structure, data types, and summary statistics.
                    2. “Data Cleaning”
                       - Handled missing values using imputation.
                       - Removed or capped outliers.
                    3. “Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)”
                       - Univariate and bivariate analysis using visualizations.
                       - Distribution of purchases by demographics and product categories.
                    4. “Feature Engineering”
                       - Created categorical encodings and derived features.
                       - Transformed skewed features for better model compatibility.
                    5. “Feature Correlation & Insights”
                       - Explored correlations between engineered features and purchase amount.
                    6. “Exporting Processed Data”
                       - Saved the cleaned and transformed dataset for further model training.
